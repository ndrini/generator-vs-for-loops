# Logic

Consider a function that, given a value of integer i, returns:  
    - if i is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print PingPong.
    - if i is a multiple of 3 (but not 5), print Ping.
    - if i is a multiple of 5 (but not 3), print Pong.
    - if i is not a multiple of 3 or 5, print the value of i.

This simple example is useful to discuss of iterators. 

# Code 
Generator versus for loop

# How to use
